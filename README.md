# Homework rules

1. All tasks should be placed in a student's own folder under a proper cataloging system, like
```
Tasks/Terentiev/TaskN/taskN.py
```
There will be cases when a task should be implemented in a several files, they should be named accordingly to the task's specifications.

2. 100 points score is assigned to each newly uploaded task.
3. Considering that many tasks could have multiple different solutions, we will consider any solution as a good solution. However, mistakes (logical or structural) can be made, and they will be highlited during a review process. If the solution is completely wrong or misses some key points of a task, the resulting score can be *decreased* slightly or some *changes in the solution* can be asked for.
4. The score can be increased for every usage of **the concept that was not mentioned on our lessons** at the moment. **Each usage** will result in a **5 point increase** _if said usage contributes to the logic of a program_.
5. Considering the previous point, **it's possible to go over a 100 points score**. Every surplus points will go to a personal accout of the student with possibility to **enhance any score for any task** with the account's points (***but not a score for the final project or the final grade itself***).
6. Any task could be reworked and proposed for re-evaluation at any time.
